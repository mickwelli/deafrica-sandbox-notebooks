    "## Background\n",
    "The [Water Observations from Space (WOfS)](https://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/community-safety/flood/wofs/about-wofs) is a derived product from Landsat 8 satellite observations as part of provisional Landsat 8 Collection 2 surface reflectance and shows surface water detected in Africa.\n",
    "Individual water classified images are called Water Observation Feature Layers (WOFLs), and are created in a 1-to-1 relationship with the input satellite data. \n",
    "Hence there is one WOFL for each satellite dataset processed for the occurrence of water.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data in a WOFL is stored as a bit field. This is a binary number, where each digit of the number is independantly set or not based on the presence (1) or absence (0) of a particular attribute (water, cloud, cloud shadow etc). In this way, the single decimal value associated to each pixel can provide information on a variety of features of that pixel. \n",
    "For more information on the structure of WOFLs and how to interact with them, see [Water Observations from Space](../Datasets/Water_Observations_from_Space.ipynb) and [Applying WOfS bitmasking](../Frequently_used_code/Applying_WOfS_bitmasking.ipynb) notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy assessment for WOfS product in Africa includes generating a confusion error matrix for a WOFL binary classification.\n",
    "The inputs for the estimating the accuracy of WOfS derived product are a binary classification WOFL layer showing water/non-water and a shapefile containing validation points collected by [Collect Earth Online](https://collect.earth/) tool. Validation points are the ground truth or actual data while the extracted value for each location from WOFL is the predicted value. A confusion error matrix containing overall, producer's and user's accuracy is the output of this analysis. "

    "## Description\n",
    "This notebook explains how you can perform accuracy assessment for WOFS derived product using collected ground truth dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook demonstrates how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load collected validation points as a list of observations each has a location and month\n",
    "2. Query WOFL data for the collected points and capture available WOfS observation available\n",
    "3. Extract statistics for each WOfS observation in each validation point including min, max and mean values for each point (location and month)\n",
    "4. Extract a LUT for each point that contains both validation info and WOfS result for each month \n",
    "5. Generating a confusion error matrix for WOFL classification\n",
    "6. Assessing the accuracy of the classification \n",
