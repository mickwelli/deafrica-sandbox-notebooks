    "## Background\n",
    "The [Water Observations from Space (WOfS)](https://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/community-safety/flood/wofs/about-wofs) is a derived product from Landsat 8 satellite observations as part of provisional Landsat 8 Collection 2 surface reflectance and shows surface water detected in Africa.\n",
    "Individual water classified images are called Water Observation Feature Layers (WOFLs), and are created in a 1-to-1 relationship with the input satellite data. \n",
    "Hence there is one WOFL for each satellite dataset processed for the occurrence of water.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data in a WOFL is stored as a bit field. This is a binary number, where each digit of the number is independantly set or not based on the presence (1) or absence (0) of a particular attribute (water, cloud, cloud shadow etc). In this way, the single decimal value associated to each pixel can provide information on a variety of features of that pixel. \n",
    "For more information on the structure of WOFLs and how to interact with them, see [Water Observations from Space](../Datasets/Water_Observations_from_Space.ipynb) and [Applying WOfS bitmasking](../Frequently_used_code/Applying_WOfS_bitmasking.ipynb) notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy assessment for WOfS product in Africa includes generating a confusion error matrix for a WOFL binary classification.\n",
    "The inputs for the estimating the accuracy of WOfS derived product are a binary classification WOFL layer showing water/non-water and a shapefile containing validation points collected by [Collect Earth Online](https://collect.earth/) tool. Validation points are the ground truth or actual data while the extracted value for each location from WOFL is the predicted value. A confusion error matrix containing overall, producer's and user's accuracy is the output of this analysis. "
